\title{Simulates a hypothetical walker moving through the time domain from software package \code{hctsa}}
\usage{
walker_propcross(y)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{the input time series}
}
\value{
fraction of time series length that walker crosses time series
}
\description{
The hypothetical particle (or 'walker') moves in response to values of the
time series at each point.
The walker narrows the gap between its value and that
of the time series by 10%.
