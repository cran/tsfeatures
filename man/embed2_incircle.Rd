\title{Points inside a given circular boundary in a 2-d embedding space from software package \code{hctsa}}
\usage{
embed2_incircle(y, boundary = NULL, acfv = stats::acf(y, length(y) - 1,
  plot = FALSE, na.action = na.pass))
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{the input time series}

\item{boundary}{the given circular boundary, setting to 1 or 2 in CompEngine. Default to 1.}

\item{acfv}{vector of autocorrelation, if exist, used to avoid repeated computation.}
}
\value{
the proportion of points inside a given circular boundary
}
\description{
The time lag is set to the first zero crossing of the autocorrelation function.
